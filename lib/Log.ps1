# Log.ps1 — structured logger for launcher and lib scripts. Dot-sourced
# (not executed). Provides Write-Log with a fixed-width 5-column format
# matching lib/log.sh exactly:
#
#   <TS>                     <LVL> <STAGE>          <EVENT>        <MSG>
#   2026-04-14T15:04:05.123Z I     tools.base       cache-hit      base-2e029a8…
#
# Columns (fixed width on every line, regardless of host or runtime):
#   TS       — RFC 3339 UTC timestamp with millisecond precision
#              (yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ, always 24 chars)
#   LVL      — single char: I | W | E (validated)
#   STAGE    — area (cred, config, tools.base, image, distro, …) padded 16
#   EVENT    — verb padded 14
#   MSG      — free-form trailing string
#
# I is dim, W yellow, E red. Output goes to the host stream.

# Threshold filtering reads `$script:LogLevel` from the dot-source
# caller's script scope. The launcher (or Ensure-Credential.ps1 when
# run standalone) sets $script:LogLevel from its -LogLevel param.
# This avoids touching $env:, which is process-wide in PowerShell
# and would pollute the caller's pwsh session after the script exits.
#
# Child processes that need to inherit the level get LOG_LEVEL
# injected explicitly at the boundary call site:
#
#   Ensure-Credential.ps1  & ./lib/Ensure-Credential.ps1 -LogLevel $script:LogLevel
#   podman container       podman run --env LOG_LEVEL=$LogLevel …
#   wsl -u root            wsl … env LOG_LEVEL=$LogLevel cmd
#   sudo (in sandbox)      sudo --preserve-env=LOG_LEVEL cmd  (env set by podman --env)
#
# Levels:
#   I   show everything (verbose; opt-in)
#   W   show warnings + errors (default; quiet on success)
#   E   show errors only

# ── ANSI color setup ──
#
# Match lib/log.sh exactly so launchers look identical regardless of
# which side they run on. Each column gets its own hue so the eye
# can scan vertically:
#   TS    gray    (90)        — recedes; only read when correlating
#   LVL   bold per-level      — I cyan, W yellow, E red, all bold so
#                               error rows pop in a wall of text
#   STAGE green   (32)        — "where it happened"
#   EVENT magenta (35)        — "what happened"
#   MSG   default             — terminal default color
#
# Probed once at module load. Disabled when:
#   - $env:NO_COLOR is set (https://no-color.org/), or
#   - stderr is redirected to a file/pipe (not a console)
# In the disabled case the format degrades to the original uncolored
# fixed-width layout — no escape bytes leak into captured output.
